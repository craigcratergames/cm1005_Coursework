Platformer Game Project – First Term Submission

This project is a side-scrolling platformer game created in p5.js for my first-year programming course. The aim of the game is for the player to control a small character through a level, avoiding hazards, collecting items, and reaching the flagpole to complete the stage. The game features a start screen, the main game, and a game-over screen, allowing for a complete loop from beginning to end.

The game world contains several interactive elements. Platforms are placed at different heights for the player to jump on, and there are collectable items scattered around the level. These items contribute to the player’s score. Canyons act as hazards – if the player falls into one, they lose a life and are reset to a starting position. A scrolling background with clouds, mountains, and trees gives the impression of a larger, continuous world. The camera follows the player’s movement, keeping the action centred on screen.

Player movement includes walking left and right, jumping, and falling. Gravity pulls the character down, and collision detection ensures the player stands on platforms instead of falling through them. Sound effects have been added to enhance the experience, with background music playing during gameplay and specific sounds for actions like collecting items or losing a life.

The level ends when the player reaches the flagpole, but this is only possible once all five collectable items have been gathered. This adds a challenge by requiring exploration before completion. Lives and score are displayed throughout, so the player always knows their progress.

Overall, this project demonstrates the core concepts of interactive programming: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and basic game logic. While it is a simple game, it has all the features needed to create a fun and complete experience, and it lays the foundation for more complex games in the future.
